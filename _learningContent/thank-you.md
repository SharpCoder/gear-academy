## Thank you

I hope you enjoyed this brief overview of gears. If you would like to contribute additional content (or corrections) please feel free to submit feedback through the [github page](https://github.com/SharpCoder/gear-academy).

Although this demonstration is basic, I will be adding further content covering even more topics in the near future.

Cheers!
