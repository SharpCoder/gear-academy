## Pressure angle

When a gear meshes with another, the angular pressure upon which the teeth connect is called the "pressure angle". Why is this important?

The curavture of the gear teeth is designed to evenly distribute the force across the entire length of the tooth. How much force is applied is a direct result of the pressure angle.

If you try to connect gears with a different pressure angle, they will lock up because the point of contact will not be contiguous.

Go ahead and change the value. What happens to the curvature of the gear teeth?

@{PressureAngleComponent}

The most common pressure angles are 14.5&deg; and 20&deg; but you don't have to stick with those values.

If you adjust the pressure angle all the way to the right, you can see how the edges get sharper and the space between the teeth is reducing. This can actually cause some problems with meshing multiple gears together.
