## What is a gear?

The purpose of a gear is to transmit / interchange torque and speed from one shaft to another.

Can you describe what happens when we introduce a driven gear that is 1/2 the amount of teeth as the main gear?

Pay close attention to

-   The speed of the new gear
-   The direction of the new gear

@{ToggleDrivenGear}

What happens when you adjust the RPM?

@{If showDrivenGear}

#### Speed

The smaller gear is turning at _double_ the speed of the bigger gear! This is one example of transmitting speed from one shaft to another.

#### Direction

Another fun fact about this new gear we've added is that it turns backwards! This is true for each subsequent gear that you add to the system. Once a gear meshes with another, it will be driving momentum in the opposite direction.
