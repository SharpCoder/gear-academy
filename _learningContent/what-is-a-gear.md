## What is a gear?

The purpose of a gear is to transmit / interchange torque and speed from one shaft to another.

Can you describe what is happening when we introduce a driven gear that is 1/2 the amount of teeth as the main gear?

Pay attention to

-   The speed of the new gear
-   The direction of the new gear

@{ToggleDrivenGear}

What happens when you adjust the RPM?

@{ResetOnLoad}
