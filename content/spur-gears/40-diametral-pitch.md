## Diametral pitch

All gears have a pitch (or module, if you're dealing with metric) which specifies how many teeth per inch of gear there will be.

What happens when you adjust the pitch slider?

The gear changes size! If you want to change how many teeth per inch of gear there is, then the spacing between each tooth will have to adjust accordingly. This is why the gear gets bigger or smaller.

To put this into perspective, here is a table which describes how the pitch changes a standard gear (in terms of full diameter):

| Teeth | Pitch | Full Diameter (in) | Full Diameter (mm) |
| ----- | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 24    | 12    | 2.167"             | 50.03mm            |
| 24    | 10    | 2.6"               | 66.04mm            |
| 24    | 8     | 3.25"              | 82.55mm            |
| 24    | 6     | 4.33"              | 110.067mm          |
| 24    | 4     | 6.5"               | 167.10mm           |
| 24    | 2     | 13"                | 330.20mm           |
